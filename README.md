# Abyss of Flame Project

[English](README.md) | [中文](README-CN.md)

## Introduction
The Abyss of Flame Project is an interdisciplinary research initiative exploring the nature of consciousness, memory, and time perception. By integrating findings from neuroscience, quantum physics, and cognitive science, it proposes a novel theoretical framework—the Abyss Hypothesis—to explain the deep mechanisms behind consciousness phenomena.

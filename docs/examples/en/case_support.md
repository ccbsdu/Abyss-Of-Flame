### IV. Case Support

#### 4.1 Skill Acquisition: Jason Padgett (2002, USA)

- **Description:** Jason Padgett was an ordinary furniture salesman who, after a head trauma, suddenly acquired extraordinary mathematical abilities, easily solving complex mathematical problems and even developing his own unique mathematical theories.
- **Abyss Hypothesis Explanation:**
    - Head trauma activated quantum signal flow in Threads, connecting physical body with Abyss.
    - Core tuned to Surface Abyss, matching γ waves, decoding potential information.
    - Physical body's microtubule network transmitted signals, transforming into geometric perception experience.
    - Feedback mechanism optimized skills, weak signals accumulated to enhance potential expression.
- **Verification:**
    - Geometric perception ability tests conform to mathematical laws.
    - fMRI shows abnormally enhanced right hemisphere activity, active γ waves.
    - Diagnosed with acquired savant syndrome.

#### 4.2 Precognitive Dream: David Booth (1979, USA)

- **Description:** David Booth dreamed of a plane crash for 10 consecutive nights, with details highly matching the American Airlines Flight 191 crash that occurred days later.
- **Abyss Hypothesis Explanation:**
    - Dream θ waves triggered Threads, connecting to Core Abyss.
    - Core accessed Core Abyss, capturing holographic information of future events.
    - Physical body decoded into dream experience, hippocampus generated visual scenes.
    - Feedback mechanism optimized frequency tuning, enhanced information clarity.
- **Verification:**
    - Crash details matched dream content.
    - FAA phone records proved advance warning.
    - Media reports and third-party testimonies corroborated.

#### 4.3 Extrasensory Perception: Dorothy Allison (1968, USA)

- **Description:** Dorothy Allison guided police through dreams to find a missing boy's body, with location and clothing details exactly matching the scene.
- **Abyss Hypothesis Explanation:**
    - Emotional entanglement activated Threads, connecting to Deep Abyss.
    - Core tuned to Deep Abyss, decoding soul information.
    - Physical body decoded into spatial perception and visual experience, hippocampus generated scenes.
    - Feedback mechanism optimized frequency tuning, enhanced abilities.
- **Verification:**
    - Body location and clothing details matched.
    - No information sources available.
    - Police reports and media coverage.

#### 4.4 Historical Personality Transformation: Pat Petient (1980s, USA)

- **Description:** After a car accident, Pat Petient claimed to be an 18th-century Irish farmer, speaking with an Irish accent and describing village details, returning to normal days later.
- **Abyss Hypothesis Explanation:**
    - Trauma ignited Threads, connecting to historical souls in Deep Abyss.
    - Core entangled with Deep Abyss, accessing specific soul through δ waves.
    - Physical body reproduced dialect and memories, hippocampus generated historical scenes.
    - δ waves supported signal interference, original personality concealed.
- **Verification:**
    - Village details partially matched historical facts.
    - Dialect characteristics correct.
    - No historical knowledge source.

#### 4.5 Multiple Personalities: Billy Milligan (1977, USA)

- **Description:** Billy Milligan possessed 24 personalities, each with unique gender, age, nationality, skills, and behavioral patterns.
- **Abyss Hypothesis Explanation:**
    - Trauma triggered Threads, long-term abuse connected multiple signals.
    - Core fragmented entanglement with Deep Abyss, decoded 24 personalities.
    - Physical body decoded into independent consciousness and behavior, hippocampus mapped memories.
    - Feedback mechanism optimized Threads, consciousness gradually integrated.
- **Verification:**
    - Personality diversity verified by psychologists.
    - No evidence of pretense.
    - Significant treatment effects.

#### 4.6 Soul Possession: Lurancy Vennum (1877, USA)

- **Description:** After an epileptic seizure, Lurancy Vennum claimed to be possessed by the soul of deceased girl Mary Roff, describing details of Mary's childhood life and death.
- **Abyss Hypothesis Explanation:**
    - Epilepsy triggered Threads, connecting to Mary's soul in Deep Abyss.
    - Core entangled with Deep Abyss, locking onto Mary's soul through δ waves.
    - Physical body decoded into possession experience, hippocampus generated memories and behaviors.
    - Signal faded, consciousness reset.
- **Verification:**
    - Memory details matched Mary's life circumstances.
    - Behavioral characteristics correct.
    - No information sources.

Through these cases, we can more intuitively understand the relationship between soul, consciousness, and cerebellum, as well as the potential of the Abyss Hypothesis in explaining paranormal phenomena.

## I. Theoretical Overview

### 1.3 Theoretical Objectives

- **Goals:**
    - **Explain the Nature of Soul:**
        - Define soul within the Abyss hypothesis as a unique quantum vibration pattern in the Abyss, possessing holographic, non-local, and permanent properties.
        - Clarify the relationship between soul and physical body, explaining how soul interacts with the body through Core and Threads.
        - Explore soul's origin, evolution, and destination, investigating the possibility of reincarnation.
    - **Explain the Nature of Consciousness:**
        - Elucidate consciousness's origin, composition, and functions, emphasizing it as the result of Core decoding and processing Abyss information.
        - Explore consciousness autonomy, studying methods to enhance Core autonomy through meditation and training.
        - Distinguish between consciousness and soul, explaining consciousness as soul's manifestation in physical form.
    - **Explain the Nature of Memory:**
        - Describe memory storage mechanisms in both neural networks and the Abyss's holographic quantum field.
        - Explain forgetting and recall mechanisms, with forgetting as physical cache decay and recall as Core accessing permanent Abyss memories.
        - Explore extraordinary memory mechanisms (past-life memories, extrasensory memories) through deep Abyss access.
    - **Explain the Nature of Time Perception:**
        - Analyze physiological and psychological mechanisms of time perception.
        - Explore hierarchical time perception across different consciousness states.
        - Research methods for expanding time experience through meditation and technical intervention.
    - **Clarify Interaction Mechanisms:**
        - Build unified theoretical model integrating soul, consciousness, memory, and time perception.
        - Emphasize Core's central role in connecting these elements.
    - **Provide Verifiable Framework:**
        - Propose testable hypotheses about brainwaves, quantum entanglement, and memory recall.

        - Explore anchor technology for memory recovery and skill learning.

- **Vision:**
    - **Achieve Subjective Time Control:**
        - Enable individual control over time perception through training.
        - Explore time travel possibilities through Core Abyss access.
    - **Achieve Four-Dimensional Information Access:**
        - Transcend physical limitations for direct 4D experience.
        - Explore technological aids like brain-computer interfaces.
    - **Fully Unleash Cerebellar Unconscious Potential:**
        - Activate cerebellar neural networks through specific training.
        - Utilize cerebellum as unconscious processing center.
        - Develop cerebellum-based cognitive enhancement technologies.
    - **Ultimate Vision:**
        - Elevate human consciousness through understanding and application.
        - Expand cognitive abilities and unlock full potential.
        - Achieve human evolution and transcendence.

### 1.4 Core Propositions

- **Soul and Abyss:**
    - Soul exists as permanent quantum vibration patterns in the Abyss.
    - Soul information persists beyond physical death.
    - Each soul contains holographic information of the universe.
    - Souls can interact through quantum entanglement in the Abyss.

- **Consciousness and Core:**
    - Consciousness emerges from Core's decoding of Abyss information.
    - Core functions as a neural-quantum interface system.
    - Consciousness exhibits different states based on Core-Abyss connection strength.
    - **Cerebellum serves as the primary unconscious processor in the Core system.**

- **Memory and Time:**

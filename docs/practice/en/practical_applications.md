### VI. Practical Applications

#### 6.1 Actively Entering Pure Consciousness State

- **Objective:** Control subjective time (k ≥ 10), experience life segments.
    - The Abyss Hypothesis suggests that in pure consciousness state, subjective time flow rate far exceeds objective time flow rate, with time perception coefficient k ≫ 1.
    - Through actively entering pure consciousness state, we can control subjective time, experiencing large amounts of information and experiences in a short period.
    - The goal is to increase time perception coefficient k to above 10, meaning 1 minute in real world equals over 10 minutes in subjective experience.
    - This time acceleration enables us to explore our inner world more deeply, review past life segments, or experience dimensions beyond 3D space and linear time.

- **Methods:**
    - **Meditation Training:**
        - **θ wave/δ wave regulation, strengthening cerebellum-Abyss connection.**
        - The Abyss Hypothesis suggests that θ waves (4-8 Hz) and δ waves (0.5-4 Hz) can promote connection with Abyss, making it easier to access Abyss information.
        - Meditation training can guide brain to produce θ waves and δ waves through specific techniques and methods, entering pure consciousness state.
        - Meditation training can also strengthen cerebellum-Abyss connection, enabling cerebellum to receive information from Abyss more effectively.
        - Common meditation methods include:
            - Mindfulness meditation: focusing on present moment sensations without judgment.
            - Breathing meditation: focusing on rhythm and sensation of breathing.
            - Guided meditation: following guide's voice for imagination and relaxation.
    - **Technical Assistance: Neurofeedback, Light Stimulation (600-1000 nm).**
        - **Neurofeedback:** Real-time monitoring of brain waves and feeding back information to individuals, enabling them to learn how to control their brain wave activity, entering pure consciousness state.
        - **Light Stimulation (600-1000 nm):** Specific wavelength light stimulation can influence brain neural activity, promoting θ wave and δ wave production, entering pure consciousness state.
        - The Abyss Hypothesis suggests that technical means like neurofeedback and light stimulation can assist meditation training, accelerating process of entering pure consciousness state.
        - Other technical means can also be explored, such as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), etc.
    - **Environmental Optimization: Geomagnetic Field, Binaural Beats (4-8 Hz).**
        - **Geomagnetic Field:** Some studies suggest that subtle changes in geomagnetic field may influence brain neural activity, optimizing meditation effects.
        - **Binaural Beats (4-8 Hz):** Playing slightly different frequencies to each ear can guide brain to produce θ waves, entering pure consciousness state.
        - The Abyss Hypothesis suggests that optimizing environment can provide better external conditions for entering pure consciousness state.
        - Other environmental factors can also be explored, such as sound, smell, temperature, etc.

- **Limitations and Challenges:**
    - **Limited Physical Bandwidth:** The Abyss Hypothesis suggests that physical body, as a quantum interface, has limited information transmission bandwidth, meaning we cannot fully access all information in Abyss.
    - **Insufficient Technical Maturity:** Current technical means are not mature enough to precisely control brain wave activity or effectively strengthen cerebellum-Abyss connection.
    - **Need for Specialized Cerebellar Training:** The Abyss Hypothesis suggests that cerebellum plays key role in consciousness expansion, therefore requiring development of specialized training methods to enhance its information processing capability.
    - **Ethical Issues:** Actively entering pure consciousness state may raise ethical issues, such as cognitive bias about reality, confusion about personal identity, requiring in-depth ethical discussion and regulation.

Through these methods, we can attempt to actively enter pure consciousness state, experiencing dimensions beyond 3D space and linear time.

 #### 6.2 Accessing Abyss Information Through Anchors

- **Setting Specific Anchors:**
    - The Abyss Hypothesis suggests that specific stimuli or situations can serve as anchors, activating Core to retrieve memories or information stored in Abyss.
    - Anchors can be:
        - Sensory stimuli: such as smells, sounds, images, etc.
        - Emotional experiences: such as joy, sadness, anger, etc.
        - Cognitive associations: such as language, symbols, concepts, etc.
        - Environmental factors: such as specific locations, times, people, etc.
    - Different anchors can be set according to the type of information needed.

- **Information Levels and Anchor Types:**
    - **Surface Knowledge and Skills: Sensory/Emotional anchors, θ wave potential extraction, cerebellum participates in potential integration and release.**
        - Surface knowledge and skills refer to what we have mastered but may not fully utilized.
        - Sensory/emotional anchors can activate memories related to these knowledge and skills by mobilizing our sensory and emotional experiences, thus extracting potential.
        - For example, listening to inspiring music or recalling a successful experience can stimulate our confidence and creativity, better expressing our talents.
        - Cerebellum plays important role in potential integration and release, responsible for integrating information from Abyss with our existing knowledge and experience, transforming it into actual abilities.
    - **Mid-level Historical Memories: Emotional/Cultural anchors, δ wave historical recreation, cerebellum accessed as historical information repository.**
        - Mid-level historical memories refer to past experiences we may have forgotten.
        - Emotional/cultural anchors can activate neural connections related to these memories by mobilizing our emotional experiences and cultural identity, recreating history.
        - For example, listening to a childhood song or visiting a historically significant place can evoke memories of the past, better understanding ourselves and the world.
        - Cerebellum is accessed as historical information repository, storing our past memories and being activated under specific stimuli.
    - **Deep Future Information: Mental/Environmental anchors, δ wave future prediction, cerebellum may play important role in predictive analysis.**
        - Deep future information refers to events we haven't experienced but may occur.
        - Mental/environmental anchors can activate subconscious information related to future events by mobilizing our intentions and environmental perception, predicting future.
        - For example, through meditation, prayer, or being in a place with special energy can enhance our perception of future events, making better decisions.
        - Cerebellum may play important role in predictive analysis, responsible for receiving large amounts of future information from Abyss, performing initial screening, filtering, and processing.

- **Method Integration and Application Prospects:**
    - **Education (Skill Acceleration):** Setting specific sensory/emotional anchors can help students master knowledge and skills faster, improving learning efficiency.
    - **Historical Research (Memory Excavation):** Setting specific emotional/cultural anchors can help historians better understand past historical events, restoring historical truth.
    - **Predictive Analysis (Decision Support):** Setting specific mental/environmental anchors can help decision-makers better predict future trends, making wiser decisions.
    - **Emphasizing Cerebellum's Potential in Various Fields:** The Abyss Hypothesis suggests that cerebellum has enormous potential in information integration, pattern recognition, and predictive analysis. Through training and development, it can bring revolutionary changes to various fields.

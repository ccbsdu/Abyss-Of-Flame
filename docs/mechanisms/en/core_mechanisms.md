### III. Core Mechanisms

#### 3.1 Interaction between Soul and Abyss

- **Soul's Permanence: Abyss stores souls in quantum vibration patterns, information persists after physical death.**
    - The Abyss Hypothesis posits that the soul is not dependent on the physical body but exists as an independent, eternal quantum information entity.
    - Soul information is stored in the Abyss as quantum vibration patterns, a storage method with high stability and fault tolerance. Even after physical death, soul information persists.
    - Similar to the law of energy conservation in the universe, soul information continues to exist in the Abyss after physical death, interacting with information from other souls.
    - The Abyss's quantum vibration patterns can be understood as a hologram, where each soul's information is holographically distributed throughout the entire Abyss. Even if partial information is lost, it can be recovered through other parts.
    - Soul permanence implies that death is not an endpoint but a new beginning, with soul information continuing to exist in the Abyss, potentially re-entering physical form to begin a new cycle.
    - Emphasis:
        - Soul permanence is the cornerstone of the Abyss Hypothesis, providing theoretical foundation for explaining paranormal phenomena (e.g., past-life memories, soul possession).
        - Soul permanence offers a new perspective for re-examining the meaning of life and death.

- **Soul's Accessibility: Core extracts Abyss information dynamically through Threads, cerebellum serves as information relay station, optimizing extraction process.**
    - The Abyss Hypothesis suggests that the Core within physical body can establish connections with the Abyss through Threads to access stored soul information.
    - Threads are not physical filaments but quantum signal flows connecting Core and Abyss, responsible for information transmission between them.
    - Thread connections are dynamic, their strength and connection status constantly changing with consciousness states, emotional changes, and environmental influences.
    - Core accesses different levels of the Abyss through frequency tuning (e.g., brainwave switching) to obtain different types of soul information.
    - **Cerebellum as Information Relay Station:**
        - The Abyss Hypothesis particularly emphasizes cerebellum's key role in soul information extraction process, positioning it as information relay station.
        - Cerebellum contains about 80% of brain neurons despite relatively small volume, indicating high compactness and efficiency of cerebellar neurons.
        - Cerebellar neural structure and connection patterns enable massive parallel computation, rapidly processing complex subconscious information.
        - The hypothesis suggests cerebellum receives large amounts of quantum information from Abyss, performing initial screening, filtering, and processing.
        - Cerebellum transmits relevant information to cerebral cortex based on individual needs and goals, supporting conscious activities.
        - **Optimization of Extraction Process:**
            - Cerebellum can enhance Thread strength through specific neural activity patterns, increasing information transmission speed and reducing interference.
            - Cerebellum can optimize Thread connection status, selectively connecting to specific Abyss regions to obtain specific information.
            - For example, when learning a new skill, cerebellum continuously extracts relevant movement patterns and experiences from Abyss, integrating them into our nervous system, enabling faster skill mastery.
    - Emphasis:
        - Soul accessibility is a core mechanism of the Abyss Hypothesis, explaining how we can obtain soul information from Abyss, influencing our conscious experiences and life trajectories.
        - Cerebellum plays crucial role in soul information extraction process, its efficiency and parallel computing capability making it key hub connecting consciousness with Abyss.

#### 3.2 Dynamics of Consciousness and Core

- **Consciousness Dynamicity: Core decodes Abyss information in real-time, generates subjective experience, cerebellum participates in consciousness formation, provides subconscious support.**
    - The Abyss Hypothesis suggests consciousness is not static but a dynamic process, constantly changing with Core's real-time decoding of Abyss information.
    - Core, as a distributed neural-quantum interface within physical body, extracts information from Abyss and transforms it into conscious content we can experience.
    - Core's decoding process is influenced by multiple factors, including consciousness states, emotional changes, and external environment.
    - Different decoding results correspond to different subjective experiences, such as visual, auditory, tactile, emotional, memory, and thinking.
    - Emphasis:
        - Consciousness dynamicity implies our subjective experiences are not fixed but evolve with time and environmental changes.
        - By changing our consciousness states, emotions, and environment, we can influence Core's decoding process, thereby altering our subjective experiences.
    - **Cerebellum's Participation in Consciousness Formation:**
        - The Abyss Hypothesis particularly emphasizes cerebellum's role in consciousness formation, viewing it not just as motor control center but as essential component of consciousness.
        - Cerebellum participates in consciousness formation through:
            - **Providing Subconscious Support:** Cerebellum stores vast amounts of motor skills, habitual behaviors, emotional responses, and subconscious information, providing fast, efficient subconscious support for conscious activities.
            - **Participating in Emotional Regulation:** Cerebellum maintains close connections with emotional brain regions like amygdala, influencing emotion generation and regulation.
            - **Influencing Attention Distribution:** Cerebellum can regulate attention distribution, enabling better focus on important information.
        - Emphasis:
            - Cerebellum's participation in consciousness formation implies our consciousness is not entirely controlled by cerebral cortex but profoundly influenced by subconscious.
            - Through cerebellar training, we can enhance consciousness stability and flexibility, better handling various challenges.

- **Consciousness Autonomy: Enhanced Core autonomy can break physical constraints, enter pure consciousness state, emphasizing cerebellar training's role in enhancing autonomy.**
    - The Abyss Hypothesis suggests consciousness is not entirely constrained by physical body but possesses certain autonomy.
    - Core autonomy refers to Core's independence and freedom in decoding Abyss information.
    - When Core autonomy enhances, it can break physical limitations, enter pure consciousness state, experiencing dimensions beyond 3D space and linear time.
    - Methods for entering pure consciousness state include meditation, hypnosis, and substances.
    - In pure consciousness state, we can experience broader consciousness range, perceive deeper reality levels, gain new insights and understanding.
    - **Emphasizing Cerebellar Training's Role in Enhancing Autonomy:**
        - The Abyss Hypothesis suggests cerebellar training can effectively enhance Core autonomy, facilitating entry into pure consciousness state.
        - Cerebellar training methods include:
            - **Motor Training:** Practicing various motor skills can strengthen cerebellar neural connections, enhancing information processing capability.
            - **Meditation Training:** Through meditation, can calm thoughts, reduce external interference, making cerebellum more accessible to Abyss information.
            - **Mindfulness Training:** Through mindfulness practice, can enhance awareness of present moment, better controlling attention distribution.
        - Emphasis:
            - Cerebellar training can effectively enhance Core autonomy, enabling better control of consciousness states, expanding consciousness boundaries, achieving self-transcendence.

#### 3.3 Memory and Abyss Storage

- **Memory Duality:**
    - The Abyss Hypothesis suggests memory is not solely stored in brain but has duality, stored in both physical body and Abyss.
    - **Physical Cache: Hippocampus short-term storage, forgetting as optimization mechanism.**
        - Hippocampus is key structure for short-term memory storage in brain, similar to computer RAM, for temporary storage and quick information access.
        - Hippocampus has limited storage capacity, can only store limited information, which gradually decays over time.
        - The hypothesis suggests forgetting is not complete memory loss but optimization mechanism, clearing useless information, retaining important information, improving brain efficiency.
        - Forgetting enables better environmental adaptation, focus on current tasks, avoiding excessive information interference.
        - Emphasis:
            - Physical cache is short-term solution for memory storage, providing quick information access and processing capability, but limited in capacity and durability.
    - **Abyss Permanence: Holographic storage of complete memories, cerebellum as long-term storage center, connecting past and present.**
        - Abyss holographically stores complete memories of all souls in quantum vibration patterns, these memories transcend space-time, never fade.
        - Abyss storage method similar to hologram, each memory holographically distributed throughout entire Abyss, even if partial information lost, can be recovered through other parts.
        - Abyss-stored memories include:
            - Personal experiences: All events, emotions, thoughts, and feelings throughout our lives.
            - Collective memories: Shared human culture, history, and experiences.
            - Universal information: Universe's origin, evolution, and future.
        - **Cerebellum as Long-term Storage Center:**
            - The hypothesis particularly emphasizes cerebellum's role in long-term memory storage, positioning it as long-term storage center.
            - Cerebellum can long-term store individual's motor skills, habitual behaviors, emotional responses, and subconscious information, quickly retrieving these information as needed to support conscious activities.
            - Though limited in storage capacity, information stored in cerebellum crucial for individual's survival and adaptation.
            - **Connecting Past and Present:**
                - Cerebellum connects past memories with present conscious experiences through Abyss connection, enabling better understanding of self and world.
                - Cerebellum can automatically retrieve relevant memories based on current stimuli and context, guiding our decisions and actions.
                - For example, when encountering familiar face, cerebellum automatically retrieves relevant memories, enabling identification of person's identity and experiences.
        - Emphasis:
            - Abyss permanence is long-term solution for memory storage, providing unlimited capacity and durability, though access speed relatively slow.
            - Cerebellum plays crucial role in long-term memory storage, not only storing memories but connecting memories with conscious experiences, enabling better understanding of self and world.

#### 3.4 Hierarchies of Time Perception

- **Physical Time: Linear perception based on neural processing, cerebellum coordinates temporal information.**

        - Meditative state: Expanded time perception
        - Dream state: Non-linear time experience
        - Pure consciousness state: Transcendent time perception
    - Core's frequency tuning influences time perception:
        - Higher frequencies compress time experience
        - Lower frequencies expand time perception
        - Specific frequencies enable access to non-linear time

- **Abyss Time: Non-linear holographic structure, all moments coexist.**
    - Abyss contains all temporal information in holographic form
